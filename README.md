# Python-Movie-Database

The Python Movie Database is a powerful and user-friendly movie management system
built using Python.  It provides a seamless way to organize, store, and retrieve
movie information using object-oriented programming principles and API calls.  This
database program allows users to list movies, add new movies by making API calls to 
retrieve relevant data, delete existing movies, update movie details, generate a
website showcasing the movie collection, and perform various statistical analyses
such as calculating average and median ratings and finding the best and worst-rated
movies.  The program leverages Python's extensive libraries, including statistics,
random, and json to deliver a comprehensive movie management solution.


In a realm of code, where classes take flight,
A movie database, shining so bright.
Python was the language, with elegance untold,
Object-oriented magic, its secrets unfold.

With each class and method, carefully designed,
A masterpiece of logic, beautifully aligned.
API calls brought data, a cinematic treasure,
Bringing movies to life, for users to measure.

But in the realm of jobs, a cloud did appear,
The software market, not as bright and clear.
The author, worried, with a heart full of fear,
Seeking opportunities, their path unclear.

Yet through lines of code, resilience did grow,
A passion for coding, their talent would show.
Object-oriented skills, a valuable art,
They ventured forward, with hope in their heart.

For in each challenge lies a chance to shine,
To prove their worth, with knowledge so fine.
The movie database program, a testament of skill,
A showcase of expertise, their dreams to fulfill.

So they code with determination, day and night,
Building their future, with all their might.
Knowing that in this vast technological sphere,
Opportunities await, when passion is sincere.
